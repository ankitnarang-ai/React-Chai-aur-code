# Password Generator Project

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a password generator application using React. The application will utilize various React hooks, such as `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`, to optimize performance and reference DOM elements.

## Features

- **Generate Secure Passwords**: The application will generate random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can easily copy the generated password to their clipboard.
- **Responsive Design**: The application will be responsive and work well on various device sizes.

## React Hooks Utilization

### `useCallback`

- **Purpose**: Optimizes the performance by memoizing the function and preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- **Usage**: The password generation function will be wrapped inside `useCallback` to ensure it is only recreated when its dependencies change, such as user-selected options.

### `useEffect`

- **Purpose**: Executes side effects in functional components.
- **Usage**: Used to handle side effects like updating the password display whenever a new password is generated. It will also manage any necessary cleanup operations.

### `useRef`

- **Purpose**: Provides a way to reference DOM elements directly.
- **Usage**: Used to reference the input element where the generated password is displayed. This allows for operations like selecting the text for copying to the clipboard.

## Implementation Details

### Components

1. **PasswordGenerator**: The main component containing all the logic for password generation.
2. **PasswordDisplay**: A component to display the generated password.
3. **SettingsPanel**: A component for user inputs to customize password criteria (length, character types, etc.).

### Functionality

1. **Password Generation**: 
    - A function to create a random password based on selected criteria.
    - Utilizes `useCallback` to memoize the function.
  
2. **Effect Management**:
    - Uses `useEffect` to update the displayed password whenever the generation function is called or dependencies change.

3. **Referencing DOM Elements**:
    - Uses `useRef` to reference the password display input element.
    - Provides functionality to automatically select and copy the password to the clipboard.

### User Interface

- **Password Display Area**: Shows the generated password.
- **Settings Panel**: Allows users to specify password length and select character types.
- **Generate Button**: Triggers the password generation function.
- **Copy Button**: Copies the generated password to the clipboard.
