Creating a Custom React Renderer
=============================

In this topic, we explored how to create our own custom React renderer from scratch. We learned about the `React.createElement` function and how to evaluate expressions passed in as objects.

Custom Renderer Function
------------------------

We created a custom renderer function that takes two arguments: `reactElement` and `container`. This function is responsible for creating a DOM element based on the `reactElement` and appending it to the `container`.

React Element Object
-------------------

We also created a sample `reactElement` object that represents a React element. This object has three properties: `type`, `props`, and `children`.

Using the Custom Renderer
-------------------------

Finally, we used the custom renderer function to render the `reactElement` to a container element with the id `root`.

What I Learned
--------------

Through this exercise, I learned about the following topics:

* How to create a custom React renderer from scratch
* The `React.createElement` function and how it works
* How to evaluate expressions passed in as objects

This exercise helped me gain a deeper understanding of how React works under the hood and how to create custom renderers for specific use cases.
