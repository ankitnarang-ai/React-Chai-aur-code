# Chapter 9: Background Color Changer

In this chapter, we learn how to create a background color changer using React's `useState` hook.

## Project Overview

The project involves creating a button that, when clicked, changes the background color of a `div` to red. This is achieved using React's `useState` hook.

### Key Steps

1. **useState Hook**: Utilize the `useState` hook to manage the background color state.
2. **Event Handling**: Implement an `onClick` event handler for the button to update the state.
3. **Styling**: Apply inline styles to the `div` based on the state.

### Example

- **Initial State**: The background color of the `div` is not red.
- **On Click**: Clicking the button sets the background color to red.

This simple interaction demonstrates how state management and event handling work together in a React component to create dynamic UI behavior.
