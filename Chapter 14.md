# Using Context API with Local Storage

## Overview

In this guide, we will explore how to integrate the Context API with Local Storage in a React application. We will cover essential concepts, such as storing and retrieving data from Local Storage, the importance of string formatting in Local Storage, and how to create a persistent To-Do application using these techniques.

## Context API with Local Storage

### What is Context API?

The Context API is a React structure that allows you to share state across the entire app (or part of it) without passing props down manually at every level. It helps in managing global state and is an alternative to prop drilling or using a state management library like Redux.

### Why Use Local Storage?

Local Storage is a web storage API that allows you to store data in the browser. Unlike cookies, data stored in Local Storage is not sent to the server with every HTTP request. Local Storage is useful for persisting data across sessions, such as user settings, preferences, or the state of a to-do list application.

### Storing Data in Local Storage

Local Storage only supports string values. Therefore, when storing data such as objects or arrays, you need to convert them to a string format using `JSON.stringify`. Conversely, when retrieving the data, you need to parse it back to its original format using `JSON.parse`.

### Methods: `getItem` and `setItem`

- **`setItem(key, value)`**: This method allows you to store a key-value pair in Local Storage. The value must be a string.
- **`getItem(key)`**: This method retrieves the value associated with the specified key from Local Storage. It returns the value as a string, which you may need to parse if it was originally an object or array.

## Creating a To-Do Application

### Application Features

Our To-Do application will have the following features:
- Add new to-do items.
- Persist to-do items in Local Storage so that they remain even after a page refresh.
- Retrieve to-do items from Local Storage when the application loads.

### Persistent To-Do Items

By leveraging the Context API and Local Storage, we can ensure that our to-do items are stored and retrieved efficiently. Each time a to-do item is added, it is saved to Local Storage. When the application loads, the to-do items are fetched from Local Storage and displayed to the user.
